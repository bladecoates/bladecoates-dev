## Site

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

## Self

I'm an Information Technology professional with 22 years in the industry. I have been fascinated with computers and technology since a very young age, and when my parents purchased their first computer when I was 13, I became hooked. Soon I installed Linux, and Red Hat 3.0, learned C/C++ and even dabbled with the <marquee> tag on Geocities. 

This site, sans <marquee>, is my new home online.
