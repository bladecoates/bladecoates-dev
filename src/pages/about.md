## Site

Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

## Self

I'm an Information Technology professional with 22 years in the industry. I have been fascinated with computers and technology since a very young age, and when my parents purchased their first computer when I was 13, I became hooked. Soon I installed Linux, and Red Hat 3.0, learned C/C++, and even dabbled with the `<marquee>` tag on Geocities. This site, sans `<marquee>`, is my new home online.

### Tools

This site is designed and built with open-source tools, technology, and frameworks. Currently, technologies include Astro, Svelte, and tailwind CSS. I primarily use Neovim or Visual Studio Code, depending on my device is being used.

### Privacy

This site attempts to use minimal javascript, local resources, and no limited third-party tracking. The "Currently Reading" section links to the following in this order:

* Authors website
* Publishers website
* Library of Congress
* Barnes and Noble (or equivalent small book site)

The commenting system is currently provided by the [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) App, with the backend utilizing Github Discussions. A self host version is available, which I am experimenting with.
