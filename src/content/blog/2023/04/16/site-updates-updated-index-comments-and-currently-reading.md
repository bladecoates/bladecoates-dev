Today I added comments to the blog posts backed by the [Giscus](https://giscus.app). It's open-source and self-hostable 
GitHub Application that uses GitHub Discussions as a comment system for blog posts. I updated the index page with the latest blog post, "Around the Web!" link post, and a "Currently Reading" section for the book I am reading. 

Other changes include code cleanup, formatting, and linting with Prettier and Stylelint.
