Welcome to my corner of the internet; the site is meant to be my creative outlet. First and foremost, developing for the front end has always been my weakness. I've always focused on developer stacks which would be considered backend, DevOps Automation, and system administration.

The site is a serious attempt to step out of my comfort zone and
learn new technologies. [Astro](https://astro.build) is powering this new site with some [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) components and using the tailwind CSS library. I plan to publish the code
on Github, currently in a private repository, once I get more details.
