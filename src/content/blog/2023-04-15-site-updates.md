Today I added a Links module to the site, allowing me to have a separate collection of link posts. The link posts are daily and appear with the regular blog posts in the RSS feed. However, I do not have a menu
item yet on the site so that you can see past link posts. I hope to integrate it with my [linkding](https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding) instance for automation. 

The RSS feed now includes the content for each blog and link post. I also performed some schema/frontmatter changes across the board.
